## General Information
- model building by using linear regression
- Business Goal:
You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes data set used

## Conclusions
- By the heatmap it is clearly all variable are multicollinear in nature, and variable have high collinearity with the target variable.
- comparing to 2018 year 2019 year was in higher booking bikes increased by 23%
- as temp booking coef by 42%
- R^2= 0.8058780993061125 & Adjuster R^2= 0.7994380362499172
- which implies model good model
- residual analysis it is equally and randomly spaced
